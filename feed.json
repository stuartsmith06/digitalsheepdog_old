my total S3 bill is about $1 per month.  Route53 is $1 per hosted zone., plus some minor DNS query cost.  </p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong>  Register or transfer a domain name</p>\n<p>From the AWS Console, go to Route53. </p>\n<p>Under Domains, click “Registered Domains” (or if you’re transferring a domain, click the “Transfer Domain” button—follow the instructions there on your own).</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/register_domain.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/responsive/register_domain-xs.png 300w ,https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/responsive/register_domain-sm.png 480w ,https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/responsive/register_domain-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"281\" height=\"56\"></figure>\n<p>Select a domain name, and go through the registration process, which will include entering your Registrant Contact information, and actually paying for the domain name.</p>\n<p>Once your domain name is set up, you’ll see it in your list of Registered domains in Route53.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/registered_domains-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/responsive/registered_domains-2-xs.png 300w ,https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/responsive/registered_domains-2-sm.png 480w ,https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/responsive/registered_domains-2-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"920\" height=\"377\"></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>  Create an S3 bucket to store your site’s content</p>\n<p>From the AWS Console, go to S3.  Under “Buckets”, click “Create bucket”.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/create_bucket.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/responsive/create_bucket-xs.png 300w ,https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/responsive/create_bucket-sm.png 480w ,https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/responsive/create_bucket-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1070\" height=\"147\"></figure>\n<p>The bucket name should match the FQDN of your website.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/bucketname.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/responsive/bucketname-xs.png 300w ,https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/responsive/bucketname-sm.png 480w ,https://stuartsmith06.github.io/digitalsheepdog/media/posts/9/responsive/bucketname-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"977\" height=\"572\"></figure>\n<p>The default setting is “Block all public access”.  Leave this box checked!</p>\n<p>You can leave Bucket Versioning and Default Encryption disabled.
